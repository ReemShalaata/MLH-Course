    "- **Repository**: Where you will store and update your projects. All files type are valid. You can have a *local repository* (on Sourcetree, for instance) and/or a *remote repository* (e.g. on GitHub) \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branch**: When creating a new repository, the default main working branch will be \"*Master*\". You are allowed to keep working on your main branch, however, if you work in groups and wish to work simultanousely on the same project, or if you want to try and test some features or changes to your project then the better way to work is by opening a new branches and merge it with the main branch (or other branches) when you're pleased and done. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Commit**: One of the main commands in Git. It creates a milestoned version of your project which you can restore any time in the future. We highly recommend you to proparly track your changes by comment (tag) it when commiting. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add**: Add files into a *staging* step, before *commit* is done. The advantage of this command is that you can fully contorl which files to commit into the next version. However, we can skip this stage and execute a direct *commit*ment if we wish to update all project's files at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clone**: When we have an online Git repository and we wish to initiate a local repository to work on your local machine (and still 'communicate' with the online one)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Push and Pull**: After both local and online repositories are exist we need to keep synchronized them to verify every one in the project will work with the most updated files. In addition, the online repository is the best way to fully backup your project. We'll use *Pull* when we want to update our local files, and \"Push\" when we want to update the online files. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Checkout**: When you have multiple branches you need to direct the HEAD of your git where you wish to work now. That's done by the *checkout* command.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">**.gitignore**: This isn't a command but a file that specifies files we want Git to ignore. </span>\n",
